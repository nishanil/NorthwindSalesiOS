NorthwindSalesiOS
=================

A simple demo to explain Infragistics NucliOS Data Visualization Controls. This project fetches top 15 selling products by categories asynchronously from [Northwind oData Service](http://services.odata.org/Northwind/Northwind.svc/) and plots it in a bar chart. It also uses IGProgressView widget to display progress.

- This project uses [oData Client](https://github.com/object/Simple.OData.Client) (included in the libs folder) for connecting to oData services

## Requirement for building the project

- Add Infragistics NucliOS Component from [Xamarin Component Store](http://components.xamarin.com/view/InfragisticsNucliOS)
